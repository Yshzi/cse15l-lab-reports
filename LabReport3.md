# Lab Report 3: Researching Commands
## Grep
Grep is a function in bash that stands for global regular expression print. 
Basically, what it does is it takes a string and file path and finds lines that 
contain the string in the file path and prints it. Modifiers can be combined with other modifiers to have a combined effect.
The following commands will be from the working directory written_2/
### grep -r (string) (filepath)[^2]
This command allows us to recursively use grep which now allows grep to be used 
on directories as well as files.
#### Command:
```
grep -r "creating" non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/
```
#### Output:
```
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch1.txt:To understand the phenomenon of communal redemption, we must turn to the Bible as our source. The model of the Hebrews’ deliverance from servitude and their ensuing acceptance of God’s law at Mount Sinai have repeatedly appealed to dominant powers of the West and often to opposite sides of the same conflict. In the rhetoric of the abolitionists, slavery in the United States made the country into “a House of Bondage.” Both blacks and whites identified with the same story of liberation from this domain of oppression. Nat Turner thought he was recreating the biblical story when he led a slave revolt in 1831. The slaves whom Harriet Tubman led to freedom in the North called her Moses. Abraham Lincoln readily saw himself in the image of Moses leading his people out of bondage into the realm of freedom.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch5.txt:There is much to be said about the proper reading of this passage, particularly in relation to the contrary story of creation in Genesis 2, a story that supposedly justifies the subordination of women. The proper reading of the text, as I have argued elsewhere,25 has God creating a single being, both male and female. God gives this being, called Adam, dominion over all the animals but not over the first woman, yet to be created. Only in the later story of the Garden of Eden do we encounter the curse and subordination of Eve. For those who look to the Bible for guidance, therefore, it makes a tremendous difference whether one relies primarily on the egalitarian message in chapter 1, of ultimate human dignity for all, or on chapter 2, with its story leading to the curse of women that they be “ruled by their husbands.”
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch6.txt:The ancient Israelites would spend forty years wandering in the desert before the passing of time would generate a new people, unaffected by the mentality of the “fleshpots of Egypt.” Modern political conditions rarely offer this luxury. The Soviets dreamed of creating a “new man” who would regard the communist system as the natural backdrop for cooperation. History never gave them the chance. But Germans could engineer a radical transformation after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of the country. The West Germans absorbed the former German Democratic Republic and then restaffed the courts and the law faculties with new personnel, drawn overwhelmingly from Western ranks.
```
Usually when grep is used on a directory it gives a message saying that the 
filepath is a directory and therefore the string cannot be searched for. 
This command is useful as we can combine it with other commands and have access 
to multiple files in different directories so long as they have the same parent 
directory.
#### Command:
```
grep -r "creating"  non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch6.txt
```
#### Output:
```

But Germans could engineer a radical transformation after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of the country. The West Germans absorbed the former German Democratic Republic and then restaffed the courts and the law faculties with new personnel, drawn overwhelmingly from Western ranks.
```
Here, since we gave a filepath to a file it only searches that one file because there's no other directory for it to go to.
###  grep -c (string) (filepath)[^1]
This method of using grep gives the number of times a string occcurs in a certain filepath.
#### Command:
``` 
grep -c "Finally" non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/*.txt
```
#### Output:
```
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch1.txt:0
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch2.txt:0
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:1
```
This output tells us that the word "Finally" was found once in 
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt and 0 times in 
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch1.txt and non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch2.txt. 
This is useful because if we were simply looking for how many times a word 
occurs in the file we have an amount. 
#### Command:
``` 
grep -c  "Finally" non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/
```
#### Output:
```
grep: non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/: Is a directory
```
When grep -c is used on a directory it is unable to search for the string and 
thus gives a message to the user. If we combined the recursive modifier and 
used grep -rc we would be able to look through the directory and have the 
same output as grep -c "Finally" non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/*.txt.
### grep -n (string) (filepath)[^1]
The -n modifier for grep makes it so the line number that the string was matched to is printed as well as the contents of that line.
#### Command:
```
grep -n "kilos" travel_guides/berlitz1/WhatToIndia.txt 
```
#### Output:
```
280:        couple of kilos, they’ll ship it for you in air-tight packages.
```
The line is being printed as well as its line number. This command can be useful when we want to know specifically where something is in a file and thus we can reference the line that it is at to get more context.
#### Command:
```
grep -nr "kilos" travel_guides/berlitz1/
```
#### Output:
```
travel_guides/berlitz1//WhereToIndia.txt:901:        separate lots of five kilos each: “three, three, three,” “four, four,
travel_guides/berlitz1//WhatToIndia.txt:280:        couple of kilos, they’ll ship it for you in air-tight packages.
```
Here, we used -nr because we used the filepath of a directory and thus with only -n we would get a message saying that the path is a directory. However, by also using the recursive modifier -r we were able to look into the directory and see that another line, 901 was printed in WhereToIndia.txt. This is interesting as grep did not see this before with the direct file path and only -n but now it found another line with "kilos" in it. By using -r perhaps we can search more deeply for a certain string in the desired filepath.
### grep -i (string) (filepath)[^1]
The -i modifier stands for ignore case so any lines that contain the string will be printed whether or not the letters are capitalized or not.
#### Command:
```
grep -i  "Two"  non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch7.txt
```
#### Output:
```
Eight- to 9-year-olds are ready for more detailed knowledge about how babies are conceived and grow, as children of this age are getting closer to puberty. A variety of well-written and illustrated books are available to help parents discuss love between partners, conception, birth, and rearing of children. Parents need to select carefully, making sure they agree with the book’s values. Two books that I like are How Babies Are Made, by Andrew Audrey and Steven Schep,14 and Where Did I Come From? by Peter Mayle.15 How I Was Adopted, by Joanna Cole,16 is an excellent starting point for discussion with preschool and young school-age children who are adopted.
Although spanking has declined over the past 50 years, the majority of parents in the United States admit to slapping or hitting their child for misbehaving.17 There is good reason not to believe in spanking. A great deal of research shows that it promotes only temporary compliance, not lasting changes in children’s behavior. Children who are repeatedly criticized, shouted at, and slapped are likely to display the unacceptable response again as soon as adults are out of sight and they can get away with it. In fact, children of harshly punishing parents develop into especially disobedient and aggressive youngsters. In a study of a national sample of over twelve hundred mothers of 6- to 9-year-olds, psychologists Murray Straus, David Sugarman, and Jean Giles-Sims found that the more spanking the mothers reported, the more antisocial behavior their children displayed two years later—cheating, telling lies, being mean to classmates, and disobeying teachers.18
It’s also important to ﬁgure out why these persistent tantrums are occurring. As the often-heard phrase “terrible twos” suggests, many people assume that tantrums are a fact of life for 2- and even 3-year-olds. Once toddlers acquire the ability to follow adult directives, one way they assert their autonomy is by resisting parents’ requests and demands, using the familiar refrain, “No!” And from time to time, toddlers lose control. When frustrated, they haven’t yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions. But parents who take mental notes for a day on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their child’’s tantrums really are. For most young children, eager, willing cooperation is much more common than opposition.26
Sonja the “child” began to mimic her daughter’s tantrums. “I want a cookie. I want two cookies! Gimme my cookies!” she shouted.
The best way for parents to ensure that only children fare well is to engage them in development-enhancing dialogues, to impose reasonable expectations for mature behavior, and to discipline effectively. Overall, parents of only children are quite successful in attaining these child-rearing goals. Contrary to popular belief, only children are not destined to become spoiled and selﬁsh. Instead, research consistently shows that they are as well adjusted and as socially competent as other children. And they form just as close and as rewarding friendships as do children with siblings, suggesting that they can and do learn to share and to be considerate of others’ needs. Furthermore, only children have a more positive sense of self-esteem and do better in school than do children growing up in families with two or more children.37 
20–26 monthsCombines two words.
Most children improve in adjustment by two years after divorce. Yet for some, emotional distress and poor school performance persist, contributing to lasting problems into adolescence and young adulthood. Adults whose parents divorced during their childhoods tend to do less well in terms of educational, vocational, and economic attainment than their counterparts from stable families.78 Regardless of whether fathers remain salient ﬁgures in children’s lives, the strongest predictor of good outcomes following divorce is effective parenting—combining warmth with reasonable maturity demands, limiting family conﬂict, and using consistent, nonpunitive discipline.79 Fathers who remain involved and who use good child-rearing techniques contribute greatly to the psychological well-being of children of both genders, with boys showing special beneﬁts.80
```
This command is useful because it allows one to search for all instances of a word even if its capitalized or not. With the default grep with no modifiers, searching "Two" and "two" would give different results as it is case sensitive.
#### Command:

non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:Bryant Park, in midtown Manhattan, is the site of a bi-annual fashion show. Twice a year, in large white tents crammed with reporters, photographers, editors, and celebrity guests, models parade designers’ wares on the runway. Bryant Park is also a good place to observe an architectural fashion show. A row of Twenties beauties lines 40th Street, along the south side of the park. First is Ely Jacques Kahn’s French Renaissance office building, originally the headquarters of Scientific American. Its neighbor is the stately Classical Engineers Club. Then comes a flapper, Raymond Hood’s American Radiator Building, whose black brick and gold trim sets it apart from its neighbors. Charles Rich’s Bryant Park Studios, an elegant survivor of the late Gilded Age, is at the Sixth Avenue corner. The large north-facing windows and glazed penthouse are a reminder that this building was originally intended for artists.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:The Chrysler Building had the distinction of being the world’s tallest building—for a few months, until it was surpassed by the Empire State Building. Although designed at the same time as the Chrysler, the Empire State is quite different in appearance. Its exterior is the architectural equivalent of a gray flannel suit. There is no decoration. The plain limestone walls lack even traditional cornices; chrome-nickel steel mullions extend uninterrupted from the 6th to the 85th floor, accentuating the building’s height. “Ornament is crime” Adolf Loos had proclaimed years before, but the stripped-down appearance of the Empire State Building owed more to an accelerated building schedule—construction took less than eighteen months—than to architectural ideology. In fact, the architects of the skyscraper considered themselves traditionalists. Richmond H. Shreve worked for Carrère & Hastings on the New York Public Library, where he met William Lamb, a recent Ecole graduate. After Carrère’s unfortunate death in an auto accident and Hastings’ retirement, Shreve and Lamb took over the firm (for several years it was called Carrère & Hastings, Shreve & Lamb) and were eventually joined by Arthur Loomis Harmon, who had worked for McKim, Mead & White on the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Despite—or rather because of—their solid Classical roots, Shreve, Lamb and Harmon designed a beautifully proportioned building that became the most famous skyscraper in the world.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:If style is the language of architecture, fashion represents the wide—and swirling—cultural currents that shape and direct that language. Gothic architecture originated in France in the twelfth century, and remained in fashion in Europe for the next three hundred years. It was used in the great cathedrals, and in such secular masterpieces as the Doge’s Palace in Venice, and the Westminster Hall in London. One of the last great Italian Gothic buildings was Milan Cathedral, begun in 1385. It was so large that the domical vault and crossing were not built until 55 years later by the great architect Filippo Brunelleschi. By then the Renaissance was well under way, thanks to Brunelleschi’s Foundling Hospital in Florence, generally considered the first building designed in the revived Classical style. With the rediscovery of Greek and Roman Classicism, Gothic became distinctly unfashionable. The old monuments were preserved, but they were not admired. “A fantastical and licentious manner of building,” is how Christopher Wren characterized Gothic architecture. So general was the dissatisfaction, that Gothic came to stand for anything that was considered wild, barbarous, or crude.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:In her novel Austen pokes fun at the genre. The abbey of the title is not a haunted ruin in Italy but a converted medieval building in Gloucestershire, complete with modern fireplaces, comfortable furniture, and other domestic conveniences. This is a reminder that by 1798, when Northanger Abbey was written, the Gothic fashion had embraced architecture. Horace Walpole was responsible for that fashion, too. In the 1750s, he had begun a project to enlarge Strawberry Hill, his Thames-side villa near London. While his contemporaries built stately houses in a delicate Classical style that was popularized by Robert and James Adam, the young Walpole, who had an independent frame of mind, looked elsewhere for inspiration. He had been an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge and admired its extraordinary Gothic chapel. The exterior of his house was battlemented like a medieval castle. The interior combined historicism with a playful eclecticism. Motifs copied from medieval altar screens ornamented the rooms—stained glass was used in windows and papier-mâché fan-vaults covered the ceiling. Walpole’s extensive collection of historical and modern books, paintings, and curiosities was also mixed in.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:The revived interest in the Middle Ages was complicated, for fashion is rarely one-dimensional. Gothic meant different things to different people (sometimes different things to the same people). Spooky Gothic novels appealed to readers. Medieval buildings appealed to the current taste for the romantic and the picturesque. Goethe’s 1772 essay on Strassburg Cathedral pointed the way; he admitted to being “a sworn enemy of the tangled arbitrariness of Gothick ornament,” but found himself overcome by the grandeur and mystery of the building, which he described as “a most sublime, wide-arching Tree of God.” The French architectural theorist Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, on the other hand, was attracted by what he interpreted as the rationalism of Gothic construction. So was his English counterpart, George Gilbert Scott, who considered Gothic more “modern” than Classical architecture, hence a more appropriate model for architects. Augustus Welby Pugin, who worked on the British Houses of Parliament, saw a moral dimension to Gothic. He considered medieval architecture to be the ideal of Christian civilization, much as Greece and Rome had been admired as the cradle of classical—but pagan—civilization. John Ruskin, too, considered Gothic a moral force, but since he also loved Venice, polychrome Ruskinian Gothic has many Italian overtones. This incongruity is particularly striking since in England especially (but also in France and Germany), the Gothic style was considered a homegrown product—as opposed to Mediterranean Classicism. This was another cultural appeal of Gothic: at a time of growing nationalism in northern Europe, it conveniently provided a “national” style.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:The Classical style has proved more durable. This has something to do with its remarkable adaptability. Whether building an administrative center for the British Raj or designing a station for the Pennsylvania Railroad workable solutions can be devised in the Classical tradition. The cultural overtones of the Classical style are even richer than those of Gothic; they include not only the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome, but also Renaissance Italian humanism, seventeenth-century Parisian splendor, Georgian London elegance, and English country-house comfort. During the immediate postwar period monumental Classical buildings also acquired authoritarian associations, since they had been fashionable in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Soviet Union. If Gothic was considered a national style by some English architects in the 1800s, Classicism, rooted in the early days of the Republic, has a claim to being America’s national style. This is most evident in Washington, D.C. Except for brief flirtations with Victorian Gothic (the Smithsonian) and functionalist modernism (the Air and Space Museum), Classicism has remained in fashion for federal buildings ever since the construction of the Palladian White House. Washingtonian Classicism has taken many guises, ranging from the Jefferson Memorial (a small version of the Pantheon), to the severely abstract Federal Reserve Board Building. The Federal Triangle and the recent Ronald W. Reagan Building are modern interpretations of the Classical tradition.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch2.txt:Architecture changes at a bewildering pace. Consider only the last 50 years of museum design. The National Gallery of Art (1937-41) in Washington, D.C. and the Museum of Modern Art (1937-39) in New York City are almost exact contemporaries. In the MoMA design, Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durrell Stone ignored the Classical tradition represented by John Russell Pope’s masterpiece. MoMA’s entrance was not up a broad flight of exterior steps but through a revolving door. Goodwin and Stone replaced the monumental rotunda by a nondescript lobby, the lofty galleries by low-ceilinged loft spaces, and limestone and marble by stucco and plasterboard. MoMA was to be the last word in avant-garde International Style, but it was scarcely finished when it was challenged by Frank Lloyd Wright’s Guggenheim Museum (1943-58), which rejected the banality of the white box by squeezing the entire museum into a dramatic sculptural spiral. Nothing could be further from the International Style than the mollusk-like exterior (especially if it had been tinted rose-red, as Wright initially wanted). In the Yale Center for British Art (1969-77), Louis I. Kahn likewise incorporated central skylit spaces, but he disavowed Wright’s loud anti-urban exterior by hugging the sidewalk and clothing his building in drab stainless steel panels. Kahn preached taming technology by consigning it to so-called servant spaces; in the Centre Georges Pompidou (1971-77), Piano and Rogers stood Kahn’s dictum on its head and gave the servants the run of the house. In the Neue Staatsgalerie (1977-83), James Stirling cheekily lifted architectural elements from both the Pompidou and the Guggenheim and combined them with a variety of historical styles. I. M. Pei’s impeccably crafted East Building of the National Gallery of Art (1976-78) in Washington, D.C., had not one exposed bolt, not one allusion to the past. Pei rejected both Stirling’s eclecticism and Piano and Rogers’ technological posturing. Instead he relied on abstract geometry for architectural effect. Frank O. Gehry’s California Aerospace Museum (1982-84) in Los Angeles is no less abstract and geometrical, but his forms bump and grind into each other almost as if by accident. “I really enjoy the awkwardness with which [the forms] touch,” Gehry observed, “as it reminds me of the cities we live in and the kind of awkwardnesses of city buildings sitting next to each other.”6 The cost of the East Building was $94.4 million; the Aerospace Museum was built on a tight budget of only $3.4 million. Lacking money for refinement, Gehry turned awkwardness into a virtue, and in the process disowned Pei’s fastidious brand of modernism. He was carefree where Pei was careful, spontaneous where Pei was studied, brash where Pei was genteel. The Aerospace Museum was clearly not a cheaper version of the East Building, it was something different.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:The projected budget for the new library was not large ($1.7 million) and Billings expected a relatively modest building.* That was not what he got. All three designs were monumental. Carrère & Hastings and Howard & Cauldwell used the Modern French style, which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the façade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for. All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors—Corinthian in McKim’s case, Ionic in the other two (the completed building is Corinthian). The compositional strategies were roughly similar: a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor; the entrance was placed in the center (more understated in McKim’s elegant design); statuary and urns adorned the attic. All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate, and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence, dignity, and of culture rooted in the past.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:The library board awarded the commission to Moshe Safdie, and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled. The new library will feature an unusual triangular-shaped main building and a curving wall-like structure that encloses a public square. A hundred years ago, it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style. Today a public library can take many guises. It can be relentlessly avant-garde, like the new $1.5 billion national library in Paris, where the books are housed in four L-shaped 22-story glass towers, and the readers are lodged in underground rooms, which the London Times described as “a series of rectangular salons (identical of course) where you can admire the ultra-smooth gray concrete, steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer.”1 A new library can be comfortably Modernist, like the new British Library in London, which the Independent humorously described as “a giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia, having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way.”2 Tom Beeby’s handsome Harold T. Washington Library in Chicago, on the other hand, is distinctly old-fashioned, with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the city’s nineteenth-century architectural tradition. Instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs, the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs. James Ingo Freed’s Main Public Library in San Francisco, on the other hand, is both old and new: the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less Classical on one façade, and more or less Modernist on another.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:Cram is right: most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion; it is stylistic consensus that is unusual. There was such a brief consensus in the late 1890s, when both architects and the American public, under the influence of the immensely popular World’s Columbian Exposition, embraced Classicism, at least for public buildings. That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition, but it began to unravel shortly after, as Cram’s essay makes clear. There was also a consensus in the 1920s, at least among progressive architects. That consensus did not last either. After 1940, Mies van der Rohe gave up the free-flowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House, and began designing buildings whose details and materials were Modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly Classical. In the 1920s, Le Corbusier proclaimed the “Five Points of a New Architecture”: the building raised on stilts; the roof garden; the frame structure that allowed a free plan; the free façade; and the horizontal ribbon window. He, too, had second thoughts. Thirty years later, his wonderful chapel at Ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame; the roof, far from being flat, resembled a billowing nun’s coif. Le Corbusier, who had coined the famous expression, “a house is a machine for living in,” now adopted distinctly un-machinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete, exposed brick, roughened stucco, and fieldstone. This volte face gave rise to the so-called Brutalist style, which had a worldwide influence, shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph, and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moore’s little house in the Berkeley hills.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:The inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected. The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them. Even Classicism, which appears at first glance to be highly regimented, is not immune. As far as we know, the ancient Greeks used only three orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Vitruvius describes them, and also refers to a Tuscan order, which is a Roman invention. Roman, too, is the so-called Composite order, an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian. The vault, the arch, and the dome, unknown to the Greeks, were other Roman additions to the Classic canon. Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since: breaking pediments, flattening pilasters, magnifying and shrinking columns, rusticating masonry. A sixteenth-century French architect, Philibert de l’Orme, invented a French order; Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroy’s House in New Delhi; more recently, Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States. Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids (columns carved in the shape of human figures) to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank. While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens, Graves’ caryatids are the Seven Dwarfs.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:The great architects—Brunelleschi, Palladio, Wren, Richardson, Lutyens—regularly looked to the past for inspiration. In 1965, Richard Meier built the Smith House, which has been called the first International Style revival building. Like all revivalists, Meier picks and chooses. At first glance, the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the 1920s: a free plan, flat roof, white walls, pipe railings, horizontal ribbon windows, a ramp. Yet it is built out of wood and steel, not masonry. The white walls are painted wood siding, not stucco; the details are more refined, the plate-glass sheets are larger, the structure lighter. The result is an International Style that is filtered through American consciousness and shaped by American technology. It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of wood—the same, but different.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:Stylistic consistency is much admired today, but it was not always so. In 1419, Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence, whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance. At the very same time, he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of Florence in a style that was not Classical but distinctly Gothic, pointed arches and all. The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin, but he also worked in other styles: Gothic in churches, and picturesque Italianate in villas. McKim, Mead & White favored the Classical style for public buildings and palatial residences, but built Norman parish churches, Shingle Style summer retreats, French Renaissance mansions, and American Colonial country houses. John Russell Pope, an eclectic master, designed beautiful picturesque Tudor, Georgian, and Colonial country estates. Edwin Lutyens was another Classicist whose residential work was eclectic.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:Inigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio, but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian “style,” any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical “style.” Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as all’antica—in the antique manner—they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression: the Romans improved on the Greeks, and they would improved on the Romans. According to the architecture historian Peter Collins, the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late. He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revett’s Antiquities of Athens, published in 1762 and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England. The authors, both architects, referred to “the Grecian and Roman style of building.”6
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:Railings have a simple function—they must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them, and they must provide a secure hand-hold: if railings are open, the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through. Classical railings, developed during the Renaissance, consist of balusters supporting a handrail. Balusters—little columns—can have a single or a double swelling curve, or a vase shape. Fabricated in wood or masonry, they can be round or square in cross-section, and plain or highly ornamented. Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens. These can be stone or metal: bronze, wrought, or cast iron. The screens can be simple X-shapes, intertwining geometrical patterns, or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases. Perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great Adirondack camps, whose builders mimicked X-shaped wrought-iron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunks.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:The house that Robert Venturi built for his mother in 1964 shook the foundations of the International Style; much of this effect was the result of details. Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiom—there is a strip window and a steel-pipe railing—he also incorporated distinctly un-Modernist features such as trim, both inside and out. Classical architects use a large variety of moldings—fillet, astragal, egg and dart, ogee—that can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect. The International Style, in its effort to do away with ornament, outlawed trim. Walls were flat planes. Windows had no frames. Joints between materials were simply hairline cracks. The conspicuous exterior dado, the baseboards, and the chair-rails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldings—they were merely boards with chamfered edges—yet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatible.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:Allan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist. He does not consider this an anomaly. “To be truly modern,” he writes, “means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present. Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed.”11 Although Greenberg looks to the past, his is not the attitude of an archeologist. Like Carrère & Hastings, and generations of architects before them, Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied, absorbed—then extended.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch3.txt:One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard. Completed in 1992, the low-lying building is shingled, but it is not exactly Shingle Style. Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts, giving them a fussy and nervous appearance. Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away. Greenberg’s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub. The one-story Atlantic façade is almost perfectly symmetrical: a large arched window flanked by two semi-circular bays, rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds. The two-story landward side is more informal, ringed by a sheltered porch. Massivity informs the details: sturdy Tuscan columns, a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof, rugged window frames. The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy: the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves. Inside, the fireplace has a brick hearth, a slate lintel, and a wood surround, whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece. The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough, reused timbers. Although most people would describe this house as “traditional,” this is not an exercise in a particular historical style. There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C. F. A. Voysey, and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens’ country houses. But this is a modern house, although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility. It admirably fulfills Palladio’s call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch1.txt:Yet delight is not uniform. The Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, for example, offers different pleasures than Thirtieth Street Station. The monumental spaces are comparable in size and function. They are both well built. Similar spaces, similar materials, yet the experience of the two concourses is different. Both buildings are inspired by the Classical architecture of the past, but Grand Central, which opened in 1913, is a modified version of Beaux-Arts Classicism, whereas the Philadelphia station, despite the Corinthian columns, is simplified, abstracted, and stylized, what historians called “stripped Classicism.” As a result, Grand Central is dramatic, visually rich in its details, almost Wagnerian; Thirtieth Street is equally dramatic but in a way that is coolly geometrical and sleekly urbane—not Wagner, Cole Porter. Style is evident in the smallest details. It ensures a continuity between the great vaulted sky of Grand Central and the ticket counters, or between the Thirtieth Street chandeliers and the announcement boards at each track stair. It is the visual language of a building. Architectural style is the manner in which the architect communicates a particular kind of visual delight, in large ways and small.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch1.txt:The world of buildings depicted in books and magazines is a scaleless, self-sufficient place. The absence of people in architectural photographs has several effects. In the past, the proportions and dimensions of buildings were based on the human body. While this was done for philosophical reasons, it also ensured a direct relationship between architecture and people—it is why even very large Classical buildings feel comfortable. By removing people from buildings, architectural photography makes it possible to regard architecture as an abstraction, unrelated to humans. It is not merely that the conventions of modern architectural photography ideally communicate the intentions of most modern architects, it is also that they validate those intentions. People? Who needs them?
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch1.txt:The connection between décor and dress can be even more intimate, for architecture sometimes directly mimics dress. The garlands in eighteenth-century buildings are sculpted or painted versions of the sashes and flowered ornaments worn by men and women. The ancient Greeks incorporated elements of dress in temple architecture. This is most apparent in colonnades, which Vincent Scully has likened to hoplites massed in a phalanx.2 There is no doubt that Classical columns were given human attributes. Ancient authors likened the vertical flutes to the folds in a chiton, or tunic.3 Columns have capitals—that is, heads. The moldings of Doric capitals were sometimes painted to resemble headbands; Ionic and Corinthian capitals incorporated carved head garlands, and the curving tendrils of Corinthian capitals often look more like hair than foliage. Indeed, Vitruvius considered the Corinthian order “feminine,” as opposed to the sturdy masculine Doric. Sir Henry Wotton went so far as to call the Corinthian order “lascivious” and “decked like a wanton courtesan.”4
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch1.txt:The little Moore barn is an historic building. Together with Robert Venturi’s Vanna Venturi House, which was designed the same year, it marks the advent of an architectural style that became known as Postmodernism.5 One of the celebrated buildings of Postmodernism is James Stirling’s Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, which was completed in 1984. Stirling vastly expands Moore’s eclecticism, combining a bewildering mixture of forms; a Doric portico, a staid neoclassical wing that matches the existing museum, an Egyptian-looking curved cornice, a colorful Russian Constructivist entrance canopy, a curving steel-and-glass wall, and two huge blue ventilator funnels lifted straight from the Centre Georges Pompidou. The monumental façade of alternating bands of travertine and sandstone is undermined by oversized fiberglass handrails that look like pink sausages. I couldn’t understand this design, except as a tour-de-force, until I visited the building. It was a wintry Sunday, and the Staatsgalerie was packed—it is one of the most popular museums in Germany. Now the architecture made sense. This museum-cum-discotheque was the perfect setting for the eclectic crowd. We were wearing every type of dress imaginable: casual wear, business suits, ski parkas, work clothes. Some people dressed up for a Sunday visit to the museum, some dressed down. Stirling’s lively collage absorbed us all. I did not see any gentlemen in Homburgs and spats, but they would have fitted in, too.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski//ch1.txt:A number of years ago I accompanied the architect Jack Diamond on a visit to a building that he had just completed at York University in Toronto. It was a student center, containing a food court and lounges on the main level and student organization offices on the second floor. The exterior of the building was decidedly traditional. Facing a landscaped common, the well-proportioned façade consisted of a colonnaded brick base supporting a row of double columns capped by a deep copper-lined cornice. Behind the colonnade, which was fitted with retractable glass panels that could be opened during warm weather, was a two-story-high hall lit by three large skylights. The exterior had a simplicity that reminded me of McKim, Mead & White, albeit without Classical ornament.

By using recursive and ignore case we are able to look through the directory and find any lines that contain "classical" ignoring the case. Therefore we can find all instances of classical whether they have a capital "C" at the beginning or not.
## Conclusion
```grep``` has many useful modifiers that can expand its already useful default capabilities. By learning more about the different modifiers that we can attach to commands, the better we can use them to our advantage. There are modifiers for almost every command so we just have to learn them and use them. Some useful resources to learn more about commands and their modifiers is man then the command. The command ```man``` stands for manual and will output a manual that details modifiers and what a certain command is used for. Additionally there is a lot of documentation online that can help one to understand how a function works. Happy coding!
