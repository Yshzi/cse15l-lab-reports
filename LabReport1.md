# **UCSD: How to Log Into ieng6**
This will be a tutorial for CSE 15L students to log into their own course-specific account on ieng6, a remote server.
## Step 1:
We are going to be installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code). If you already have the application from a previous class or other circumstance you can skip to [Step 2](https://github.com/Yshzi/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/46af0e8204ca78db9ccc60b5a2b89701f99cda74/VSCodeStartScreen.jpg).
Go to the Visual Studio Code website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Click the down arrow to choose your operating system and download the stable build of your operating system.

Go through with the installation and install it onto your computer.

## Step 2:
Great! Now you have VS Code on your computer. Open up VS Code and go to the top of the window (for mac users this will be at the very top of your screen) and click terminal then new terminal.
